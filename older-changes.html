<h2>Link Grammar Parser Older Changes</h2>
<h3>Summary of Older Changes</h3>

<p>Version 5.10.5 (17 June 2022)</p>

</ul>

<p>Version 5.10.4 (4 March 2022)</p>
<p>
This is a notable and important release, as it is the first to
include a complete Thai dictionary!
<p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Fix perl bindings build fail. #1248
</ul>

<p>Version 5.10.0 (4 September 2021)</p>
<p>
The minor version number has been bumped because of a change to the
link types used for idioms. Subscripts with an underbar are now
reserved.
<p>
Users of the unsupervised language learning project will need
this version. It contains fixes for random corpora generation.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded English vocabulary
<li>Support dictionary "#define allow-duplicate-words true". #1204

<li>Fix build break when SQLite3 is not installed. #1195
</ul>

<p>Version 5.9.0 (25 April 2021)</p>
<p>
An experimental sentence generator has been added. This generator will
create new grammatical sentences, based on a "fill in the blanks"
approach to specifying a template sentence. The dictionary is scanned
for any suitable words that might fit into wild-card locations; the
resulting sentences are then printed. This is particularly useful for
generating random corpora of grammatically valid sentences.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use #define for custom configuration in dictionaries. #1128

<li>Increase number of allowed idiom expressions. #1187
<li>Replace O(n^2) idiom loading algo by an O(n log n) algo. #1194
<li>Disable SAT solver by default.
<li>New tool: Sentence generator! This is an experimental prototype.
</ul>

<p>Version 5.8.1 (8 January 2021)</p>
<p>
Assorted fixes.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fix macOS/SunOS build break.
<li>English dict: fix numerical identifiers used as adjectives.

<li>Fix race condition in spell-guesser. #1122 #1123
</ul>

<p>Version 5.8.0 (28 February 2020)</p>
<p>
Notable changes include: inclusion of javascript node.js bindings;
the obsoleting of python2, improved English dictionaries, and most
interestingly, an experimental interface for dialects. With this
interface, one can provide alternative weightings that emphasize
the type of speech that might be common in limited geographical
areas, and would not be considered to be commonplace. For example,
one can provide weightings for Irish-American, urban English, and
newspaper-headline English which might otherwise interfere with
ordinary parsing of mainstream English.

<li>Java bindings: Remove the obsolete senses API.
<li>swig-4.0 compatibility bug fix.

<li>Add !!word/ link-parser command for displaying extended word dict info.
</ul>

<p>Version 5.7.0 (13 September 2019)</p>
<p>
This version has one quite remarkable change: the parsing of long
sentences has been improved by a factor of 3x or 4x, and thus, the
parse speed of many "typical" texts is doubled, or more. Two other
important fixes are for broken 32-bit support, and for Windows.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor efficiency improvements to the SQL-backed dictionary.

<li>Fat-linkage code: fix it so it compiles again.
<li>Sat-solver: re-enable it so that it runs.
</ul>
<p>Version 5.1.0 (29 August 2014)</p>
<p>
This version includes a number of important changes. One of these is
that the connectors can now be given a direction (head and tail
indicators), so that link-grammar dependencies can now be true,
hierarchical dependency arrows.  This is of marginal importance for
English, where dependency directions are implicit, but is vital for
free-word-order languages, where bi-directional links are not enough.
</p><p>
Another important change is that costs can now be arbitrary floating
point numbers. This is particularly useful for providing fine-grained
parse ranking.  The LG cost system assigns a "cost" to every connector,
and the sum-total of costs for a sentence determines the parse ranking.
Since costs are additive, they behave as entropies (log P -- the
logarithm of a probability: probabilities are multiplicative, logarithms
are additive).
</p><p>
Under the covers, there's been some major work on the tokenization
(splitting sentences into words) and morphology (splitting words into
morphemes) code.  This work is ongoing, and should eventually result in
much better support for non-English languages.
</p><p>
Other notable changes include an updated Russian dictionary, and an
assortment of changes to the English dictionary.  An intriguing step
towards phonology: LG can now distinguish between the use of the
determiners "a" and "an" preceding nouns that start with consonants
or vowels.  Whether fancier phonology support is possible is a curious
question.

<p>Version 5.0.0 (1 April 2014)</p>
<p>
We are proud to announce a major new release of the Link Grammar Parser!
It contains many important changes and new additions.  One of the most
significant changes is that the license has been changed from the BSD
license to the LGPL.  This was done to enable considerably more
flexibility in accepting contributions to the project: it seems that
few are particularly interested in contributing to a BSD-licensed project.
This change has enabled folding in some new work:
<ul>
<li>Arabic and Persian dictionaries!  These were previously maintained
   as separate add-ons.  Including them as part of the distribution
   should make it easier for interested users.

<li>A new 'bindings' directory, containing code for Java, Python, Common
   Lisp, OCaML and AutoIt programming languages.  The Python bindings
   are an updated version of the older pylinkgrammar-0.2.13 bindings.
   A SWIG interface file should make it easy to create other language
   bindings as well.

<li>Improved morphology support. This will be invisible to most users,
   but it lays the groundwork for add Hebrew support to the parser.

<li>Expanded Lithuanian support. This remains a simplistic prototype, but
   it now performs a more sophisticated morphological analysis.

<li>Experimental Turkish and Hebrew dictionaries.

<li>A demo of the JSON parser server: it shows how to run the server,
   which will accept accept raw sentences on a socket, and returns the
   parsed forms.

<li>Some slightly incompatible changes to the API: it was time for some
   housekeeping.

<li>Misc minor updates to the English Language dictionaries.

<li>Preliminary work for SQL-backed dynamic dictionaries. This should
   enable certain types of automated language learning.
</ul>

<p>The full ChangeLog is shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>License upgrade to LGPLv2.1
<li>Arabic dictionaries, from Jon Dehdari

<li>Windows: UTF-8 fixes so that Russian works in most MSWindows locales.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Version 4.8.0 (24 October 2013)
</p><p>
This is the start of a new version series, containing an important
change to the English language dictionary. Three new link types are
introduced WV, CV and IV. These are used to connect the left-wall to
the primary verb of the sentence (WV), to connect the ruling clause
to the primary verb of a dependent clause (CV), and a similar link
for certain infinitive verbs (IV).  The goal of these links is to
make it easier to locate verbs, and thus to provide a more direct
mapping from the link-grammar formalism to a dependency parse (as
dependency parses always put the verb at the root of a sentence).
</p><p>
These are not the first links that explicitly indicate root verbs:
several other link types already play this role: The AF, CP, Eq, COq
and B links already play this role. The new WV, CV and IV links
round out this capability and do so in a very general form.  See
<a href="./dict/section-WV.html">WV</a>,
<a href="./dict/section-CV.html">CV</a> and
<a href="./dict/section-IV.html">IV</a>
for details.
</p><p>
With this release, we expect that all (non-auxiliary) verbs in a
sentence will be linked either to the wall, or to a controlling parent.
We also expect there to be some additional fixes and tightening-up
to occur in future releases, especially in regards to comparative
sentences.
</p><p>
This release also includes a variety of fixes to the Java API/server.
In addition, some ancient, deprecated C code was removed.
