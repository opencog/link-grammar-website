AN connects noun-modifiers to nouns.

         +-----------D-----+
         |    +-----AN-----+
	 |    |	    +--AN--+--S--+
         |    |     |      |     |
	The income tax proposal was rejected

Any singular noun may be used as a noun-modifier. All the
noun-modifiers of a phrase are connected to the main noun of
the phrase. Any number of noun modifiers may be connected.
Thus nouns have a "@AN-" connector, conjoined with the rest of
their expressions. Noun modifiers therefore always connect in
parallel, rather than serially (sometimes this is
counterintuitive, as in "income tax proposal").

Noun-modifiers must normally occur after ordinary adjectival
modifiers: "The stupid tax proposal was rejected", "*The tax
stupid proposal was rejected". However, there are exceptions
to this: "city clerical worker", "New York municipal
bonds". For this reason, AN connections closer to the noun
than A connections (or when no A connection is made) are
allowed with cost 0; with cost 2, we allow AN connections
further away than A connections. Nouns therefore have the
following:

dog:  {@AN-} & {@A- & {[[@AN-]]}} & ...

In general, noun-modifiers may not be plural: "*The taxes
proposal was rejected", "*I made an eggs sandwich". However,
one does sometimes see plural noun modifiers: "arms control",
"sales division", "weapons violations charges". Here again, we
use the cost system, giving plural nouns "AN+" a cost of 2:

dog: ({@A-} & D- & (S+....)) or AN+
dogs: ({@A-} & D- & (S+....)) or [[AN+]]

Noun modifiers may also not take determiners or post-nominal
modifiers: "*The tax on liquor proposal was rejected" (unless
hyphenated: see "<A HREF="section-A.html">A</A>"). Thus the AN+ on nouns is disjoined 
from the rest of the expression.

Proper nouns also have an AN+ connector, allowing them to act
as modifiers to nouns: "The Smith tax proposal was
rejected". (Proper-noun modifiers are allowed to follow
ordinary noun modifiers, which is incorrect: "*The tax Smith
proposal was rejected" is accepted.)
