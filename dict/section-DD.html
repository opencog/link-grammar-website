DD is used to connect definite determiners ("the", "his", "Jane's")
to number expressions and adjectives acting as nouns.

DD connects determiners to number expressions:

	 +-DD-+--D--+
	 |    |     |
	My three sisters are coming next week

              +---------S-------+
         +-DD-+-M-+             |
         |    |   |             |
	The  two in the window are very attractive

In the first case above, the number expression is really
acting as the determiner (there must be number agreement with
the subject: "*My three sister is coming"); the other
determiner is superfluous. In the second case, the number 
acts as a noun-phrase; note that it may take prepositional 
phrases, relative clauses, etc., just like an ordinary noun. 
In either case, the number does not require a DD connection; 
it is optional. Numbers therefore have the following:

	three: {DD-} & (Dmc+ or 
	({@M+ or ...} & (S+ or O-...)));

Only certain determiners may be used here: "*A three sisters
are coming","*Many three students are coming".

DD is also used to connect determiners to adjectives when they
are being used as self-contained noun-phrases. Here again, the
definite determiner is most often used; possessive determiners
can perhaps be used (we allow them); but singular and
plural-mass determiners are incorrect, as is use with no
determiner.
                                         
                         +----O-----+       +---O----+
                         |     +-DD-+       |    +-DD+
                         |     |    |       |    |   |
	This law will benefit the rich and hurt the poor

	?This law will benefit our rich and hurt our poor
	*This law will benefit a rich and hurt some poor
	*This law will benefit rich and hurt poor

Adjectives may be used in this way as subjects ("The poor will
suffer"), objects ("It will affect the poor"), or
prepositional objects ("It applies to the poor"). When used as
subjects, adjectives act as plural forms ("The poor are/*is
going to suffer"). This construction is most often seen with a
few adjectives such as "rich", "poor", "powerful", "meek", and
"famous". We allow it with all adjectives; however, since it
is quite rare, we give it a cost of 2. Adjectives therefore
have:

	poor: A+ or (Pa- & &lt;complement&gt;) or 
		[[DD- & (Sp+ or SIp- or O- or J-)]];

With superlative adjectives ("biggest", "first"), this noun-phrase
usage is much more common: "She is the best I have seen". Thus
superlative adjectives have noun-phrase connectors, conjoined with 
DD-, with zero cost.  (They may also be singular or plural;
"The best is Sue", "The best are Sue and Lisa".)
