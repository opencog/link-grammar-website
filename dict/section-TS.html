TS is used in subjunctive constructions. It connects certain
verbs that can take subjunctive clauses as complements -
"suggest", "require" - to the word "that".  Such verbs have
TS+, disjoined with other complement connectors (TH+, TO+,
etc.). The word "that" has "TS- & SI*j+ & I*j+". Thus "that"
connects to a subject (all nouns and nominative pronouns have
SI- connectors) and to an infinitive verb; the subject and
verb do not connect to each other.

                     +----I--+
              +--TS--+-SI-+  |
              |      |    |  |
	I suggested that  he go

SI links are mainly used in questions where there is question
inversion ("Did he go", "Where did he go", "Who did he
see"). The use of SI is highly constrained in post-processing,
and is usually only permitted in questions; to avoid this, we
give the SI+ connectors here a special subscript, SI#j. See
"<A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A>: Other uses besides questions".

TS is also used for certain adjectives that take subjunctive:
"It is IMPORTANT THAT he go". TSi is used here, since only
the the "filler-it" may be used as a subject. 

Notice that the "I+" connector on "that" is also subscripted:
"I*j+". This connector starts an "urfl domain" (see "<A HREF="section-TO.html">TO</A>o".)
The domain structure below is thus formed:

                     +-I*j(x)----+
              +--TS--+SIsj(x)-+  |
              |      |        |  |
	I suggested that     he go

We thereby capture the intuition that the SI link and the
I link in a subjunctive clause form part of a single
subject-verb expression, distinct from the previous subject-
verb expression.
