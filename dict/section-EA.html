EA connects adverbs to adjectives. Certain adverbs can modify
adjectives ("very", "quite", "relatively"); these have EA+
connectors. Adjectives have optional "EA-" connectors.

            +----Pa-----+
	    |   +--EA---+
	    |	|       |
	He is pretty stupid

Since the adverbial adjective must always connect to the 
adjective closer than anything else, the EA- on adjectives is
at the far left of the expression. Adjectives thus carry
"{EA-} & (A+ or Pa- or AF-...)".

<B>EAh</B>
EAh connects to adjectives in the same manner as "EA". EAh+
occurs only on the word "how", and is used in adjectival
questions:

    +-Wq-+EAh-+-----AF-----+
    |    |    |            |
  /////	How stupid can you be

(Also indirect questions: "I wonder how stupid he can be.""
	
On adjectives, "EA-" is optionally conjoined with "Pa+ or A+
or AF-".  It would seem, then, that there is nothing to
prevent EAh being used with Pa- (exs. 1 and 2 below) or A+
(ex. 3):

                +---Pa--+
            +-S-+  +-EAh+  &lt;-- ?
            |   |  |    |
	1. *He is how stupid.

	2. *He is I wonder how stupid.
	3. *The how stupid man is here.

This problem is analagous to that of question-word determiners
("*He bought I wonder which book"), and is prevented in
exactly the same way (see "<A HREF="section-D.html">D</A>##w"). Like "D**w+" on "which",
EAh+ on "how" is conjoined with "QI- or Wq- or Ws-", and
therefore must make a link back either to an verb taking
indirect questions ("wonder", "know") or to the wall.
Therefore, in ex. 1 and 3, no linkage is found. QI- also
starts an 's' domain, which is bounded: i.e., it is prohibited
from spreading back to the left of its root word. Thus ex. 2
is prohibited in post-processing. In practice, then, EAh only
occurs with AF, never with A or Pa.

There is one problem, however. Usually question-word
determiners can be used in noun-focused (subject- or
object-type) questions: "Which dog did you chase", "Which dog
chased you". Similar linkages might be imagined, involving EAh
links:

            +-EAh+-A--+
            |    |    |
	1. *How big dogs did you chase
	2. *How big dogs chased you.

However, such constructions are clearly incorrect.  Thus these
must be prevented somehow. Another point: Notice that the noun
here is plural. With singular nouns, a determiner is required,
so no such linkage can be formed (*"How a big dog did you
chase" would involve crossing links).  However, there is a way
of expressing this thought: ex. 3 below.  With subject-type
questions, though, even this construction seems wrong (ex.4):

	3. How big a dog did you chase?
	4. *How big a dog chased you?

Other questions with "how" seem fine: subject- or object-type
question like 5 and 6, involving "how many" or "how much", or
adjectival questions like 7.

	5. How many dogs did you chase?
	6. How many dogs chased you?
	7. How big was it?

The rule seems to be that if a question is "adjective-focused"
(that is, if the degree of the adjective is what is being
asked about), it must be a "be" type question (using AF),
rather than a subject-type (S) or object-type (B) question,
unless it is an object-type question using "how (adj) a
(noun)" (as in ex. 3). (We must also of course enforce s-v
inversion in questions, and prevent it in indirect questions;
this involves other link-types. See "<A HREF="section-SI.html">SI</A>: Questions requiring
s-v inversion".)

How do we enforce these constraints? First we must allow the
rather odd construction in ex. 3. To do this we use HA and
AA links (see "<A HREF="section-AA.html">AA</A>" for a fuller explanation):

	how: (EAh+ & {HA+})...;
	big: EA- & (AA+ or A+ or Pa-...);
        a: {AA- & HA-} & Ds+;

This yields the following:

         +---HA---+    
         +EAh+-AA-+-Ds-+
         |   |    |    |
        How big   a   dog was it        

But this allows both 3 and 4; 4 must be prevented. Moreover,
plural constructions, both subject and object-type (ex. 1 and
2), must be prevented too. (We cannot make the HA+ obligatory
on "how"; EAh is often used on its own, as in "How big is
it".) We prevent these constructions in post-processing. We
simply state that EAh links can only be used when one of a
list of links is present in the group: either AF (as in
ordinary adjectival questions) or Bsm (as in ex. 3).  Thus we
weed out all constructions where the noun of the "how" phrase
is either a subject or where it is a plural object.  This
applies in the same way to indirect questions.  (Note that
with indirect questions analogous to ex. 2 above - "I wonder
how big dogs chase you" - another interpretation is possible
in which "how" is analagous to "when"; this is correct and is
accepted.)

<B>EAxk: "so...that"</B>
EAxk is used in the construction "so [adjective] that [clause]":

                +EAxk+-MVh-+-C-+
                |    |     |   |
	It was so  cold  that we decided not to go

When the word "so" is used in this way, it allows
"that+clause" to follow.  "So" seems to be acting like an
adjectival adverb here, since it may not be combined with
another adverb: "*It was so extremely cold".  Thus it seems
logical to connect it to the adjective using EA, normally used
for adverbs modifying adjectives. We also give "that" an MV-
connector, allowing it to attach to a preceding verb or
adjective. But now there is nothing to prevent "that+clause"
from modifying <B>any</B> previous verb or adjective: "*It was cold
that we decided not to go". We prevent this using
post-processing. The EA+ on "so" is specially subscripted as
EAxk+; in post-processing, we state that any group containing
an MVh must contain an EAxk.

The same process can be used to control other "so...that"
constructions:

               +-------------MVh-----------+
               +---------O-------+         |
               |       +EAxk+-Dmc+         |
               |       |    |    |         |
        There were     so many snowdrifts that we decided not to go

                       +EExk+
                       |    |
        It was raining so hard that we decided not to go
        There was      so much snow that we decided not to go
        It was raining so much that we decided not to go

With "so many", we use EAxk, so no further arrangements are
necessary.  "So...that" constructions can also be formed with
"so" as an adverbial adjective; for this we use "EExk". We
also use EExk for "so much" constructions (whether "much" is
an adverb, determiner, or noun-phrase). A related construction
is "such...that".

                  +----------MVh---------+
                  |          +-Dm*k+     |
                  |          |     |     |
        It was raining with such force that we decided not to go

Here, too, using "such" as a determiner permits "that+clause"
to follow.  For this purpose, "such" carries "Dm*k+"; Dm*k is
added to the list of link-types that permit MVh in
post-processing.  ("Such_a", the singular equivalent, works in
a similar way, using Ds*k.)

Other EA subscripts relate to comparatives: see "<A HREF="section-MV.html">MV</A>:
Comparatives", sections II (EAm) and VII (EAy).
