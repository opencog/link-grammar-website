These changes are permanent, and are expected to remain valid into the
indefinite future.

<h3>What is Link Grammar?</h3>

<p>The Link Grammar Parser exhibits the linguistic (natural language)
structure of English, Thai, Russian, Arabic, Persian and limited subsets
of a half-dozen other languages. This structure is a graph of typed
links (edges) between the words in a sentence. One may obtain the
more conventional HPSG (constituent) and dependency style parses
from Link Grammar by applying a collection of rules to convert to
these different formats. This is possible because Link Grammar goes
a bit "deeper" into the "syntactico-semantic" structure of a sentence:
it provides considerably more fine-grained and detailed information
than what is commonly available in conventional parsers.
</p>

<p>The theory of Link Grammar parsing was originally developed in 1991
by Davy Temperley, John Lafferty and Daniel Sleator, at the time
professors of linguistics and computer science at the Carnegie Mellon
University.  The three initial publications on this theory provide the
best introduction and overview; since then, there have been hundreds
of publications further exploring, examining and extending the ideas.
</p>

<p>Although based on the
<a href="https://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/">original Carnegie-Mellon code
base</a>, the current Link Grammar package has dramatically evolved and is
profoundly different from earlier versions.  There have been innumerable
bug fixes; performance has improved by more than an order of magnitude.
The package is fully multi-threaded, fully UTF-8 enabled, and has been
scrubbed for security, enabling cloud deployment.  Parse coverage of
English has been dramatically improved; other languages have been added
(most notably, Thai and Russian). There is a raft of new features,
including support for morphology, dialects, and a fine-grained weight
(cost) system, allowing vector-embedding-like behaviour. There is a
new, sophisticated tokenizer tailored for morphology: it can offer
alternative splittings for morphologically ambiguous words.
Dictionaries can be updated at run-time, enabling systems that perform
continuous learning of grammar to also parse at the same time. That is,
dictionary updates and parsing are mutually thread-safe. Classes of
words can be recognized with regexes. Random planar graph parsing is
fully supported; this allows uniform sampling of the space of planar
graphs.
</p>

<p>The latest addition is an experimental sentence generator; it is
being used in the <a href="https://github.com/opencog/learn">OpenCog
Language Learning</a> project, which aims to automatically learn Link
Grammars from corpora, using brand-new and innovative information
theoretic techniques, somewhat similar to those found in artificial
neural nets (deep learning), but using explicitly symbolic representations.
</p>

<h3>Quick Overview</h3>
<p>
The parser includes API's in various different programming languages,
as well as a handy command-line tool for playing with it.  Here's some
typical output:
</p>
<pre>
              linkparser&gt; This is a test!
                 Linkage 1, cost vector = (UNUSED=0 DIS= 0.00 LEN=6)
              
                  +-------------Xp------------+
                  +----->WV-----&gt;+---Ost--+   |
                  +---Wd---+-Ss*b+  +Ds**c+   |
                  |        |     |  |     |   |
              LEFT-WALL this.p is.v a  test.n !
              
              (S (NP this.p) (VP is.v (NP a test.n)) !)
              
                          LEFT-WALL    0.000  Wd+ hWV+ Xp+
                             this.p    0.000  Wd- Ss*b+
                               is.v    0.000  Ss- dWV- O*t+
                                  a    0.000  Ds**c+
                             test.n    0.000  Ds**c- Os-
                                  !    0.000  Xp- RW+
                         RIGHT-WALL    0.000  RW-
</pre>
<p>
This rather busy display illustrates many interesting things. For
example, the <kbd>Ss*b</kbd> link connects the verb and the subject, and
indicates that the subject is singular.  Likewise, the <kbd>Ost</kbd> link
connects the verb and the object, and also indicates that the object
is singular. The <kbd>WV</kbd> (verb-wall) link points at the head-verb of
the sentence, while the <kbd>Wd</kbd> link points at the head-noun. The
<kbd>Xp</kbd>
link connects to the trailing punctuation. The <kbd>Ds**c</kbd> link connects
the noun to the determiner: it again confirms that the noun is singular,
and also that the noun starts with a consonant. (The <kbd>PH</kbd> link, not
required here, is used to force phonetic agreement, distinguishing
'a' from 'an').  These link types are documented in the
<a href="./dict/index.html">
English Link Documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bottom of the display is a listing of the "disjuncts" used for
each word. The disjuncts are simply a list of the connectors that
were employed to form the links. They are particularly interesting
because they serve as an extremely fine-grained form of a "part of
speech" or "grammatical category", although they also can be interpreted
as
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(linguistics)">semantic
selections</a>".
Thus, for example: the disjunct <kbd>S- O+</kbd> indicates a
transitive verb: its a verb that takes both a subject and an object.
The additional markup above indicates that 'is' is not only being used
as a transitive verb, but it also indicates finer details: a transitive
verb that took a singular subject, and was used (is usable as) the head
verb of a sentence.  The floating-point value is the "cost" of the
disjunct; it very roughly captures the log-likelihood of this particular
grammatical (and semantic!) usage.  Much as parts-of-speech correlate
with word-meanings, so also fine-grained parts-of-speech correlate with
much finer distinctions and gradations of meaning.
</p>
<p>
The link-grammar parser also supports morphological analysis. Here is
an example in Russian:
</p>
<pre>
              linkparser&gt; это теста
                 Linkage 1, cost vector = (UNUSED=0 DIS= 0.00 LEN=4)
              
                           +-----MVAip-----+
                  +---Wd---+       +-LLCAG-+
                  |        |       |       |
              LEFT-WALL это.msi тест.= =а.ndnpi
</pre>

<p>
The <kbd>LL</kbd> link connects the stem 'тест' to the suffix 'а'. The
<kbd>MVA</kbd>
link connects only to the suffix, because, in Russian, it is the
suffixes that carry all of the syntactic structure, and not the stems.
The Russian lexis is
<a href="./russian/doc/">documented here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Thai dictionary is now fully developed, effectively covering the
entire language.  An example in Thai:
</p>
<pre>
            linkparser&gt; นายกรัฐมนตรี ขึ้น กล่าว สุนทรพจน์
               Linkage 1, cost vector = (UNUSED=0 DIS= 2.00 LEN=2)
            
                +---------LWs--------+
                |           +<---S<--+--VS-+-->O-->+
                |           |        |     |       |
            LEFT-WALL นายกรัฐมนตรี.n ขึ้น.v กล่าว.v สุนทรพจน์.n
</pre>

<p>
The <kbd>VS</kbd> link connects two verbs 'ขึ้น' and 'กล่าว' in a serial verb
construction. A summary of link types is
<a href="https://github.com/opencog/link-grammar/tree/master/data/th/README.md">
documented here</a>. Full documentation of Thai Link Grammar can be
<a href="https://github.com/opencog/link-grammar/tree/master/data/th/LINKDOC.md">
found here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thai Link Grammar also accepts POS-tagged and named-entity-tagged
inputs. Each word can be annotated with the Link POS tag. For example:
</p>
<pre>
            linkparser&gt; เมื่อวานนี้.n มี.ve คน.n มา.x ติดต่อ.v คุณ.pr ครับ.pt
            Found 1 linkage (1 had no P.P. violations)
               Unique linkage, cost vector = (UNUSED=0 DIS= 0.00 LEN=12)
            
                                      +---------------------PT--------------------+
                +---------LWs---------+---------->VE---------->+                  |
                |           +<---S<---+-->O-->+       +<--AXw<-+--->O--->+        |
                |           |         |       |       |        |         |        |
            LEFT-WALL เมื่อวานนี้.n[!] มี.ve[!] คน.n[!] มา.x[!] ติดต่อ.v[!] คุณ.pr[!] ครับ.pt[!]
</pre>

<p>
Full documentation for the Thai dictionary can be
<a href="https://github.com/opencog/link-grammar/tree/master/data/th/INPUT_FORMATS.md">
found here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Thai dictionary accepts LST20 tagsets for POS and named entities,
to bridge the gap between fundamental NLP tools and the Link Parser.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
            linkparser&gt; linkparser> วันที่_25_ธันวาคม@DTM ของ@PS ทุก@AJ ปี@NN เป็น@VV วัน@NN คริสต์มาส@NN
            Found 348 linkages (348 had no P.P. violations)
               Linkage 1, cost vector = (UNUSED=0 DIS= 1.00 LEN=10)
            
                +--------------------------------LWs--------------------------------+
                |               +<------------------------S<------------------------+
                |               |                +---------->PO--------->+          |
                |               +----->AJpr----->+            +<---AJj<--+          +---->O---->+------NZ-----+
                |               |                |            |          |          |           |             |
            LEFT-WALL วันที่_25_ธันวาคม@DTM[!] ของ@PS[!].pnn ทุก@AJ[!].jl ปี@NN[!].n เป็น@VV[!].v วัน@NN[!].na คริสต์มาส@NN[!].n
</pre>

<p>
Note that each word above is annotated with LST20 POS tags and NE tags.
Full documentation for both the Link POS tags and the LST20 tagsets can be
<a href="https://github.com/opencog/link-grammar/tree/master/data/th/TAGSETS.md">
found here</a>. More information about LST20, e.g.
annotation guideline and data statistics, can be
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05055">found here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <kbd>any</kbd> language supports uniformly-sampled random planar graphs:
</p>
<pre>
            linkparser&gt; asdf qwer tyuiop fghj bbb
            Found 1162 linkages (1162 had no P.P. violations)
            
                         +-------ANY------+-------ANY------+
                +---ANY--+--ANY--+        +---ANY--+--ANY--+
                |        |       |        |        |       |
            LEFT-WALL asdf[!] qwer[!] tyuiop[!] fghj[!] bbb[!]
</pre>
<p>
The <kbd>ady</kbd> language does likewise, performing random morphological
splittings:
</p>
<pre>
            linkparser&gt; asdf qwerty fghjbbb
            Found 1512 linkages (1512 had no P.P. violations)
            
                                              +------------------ANY-----------------+
                +-----ANY----+-------ANY------+                  +---------LL--------+
                |            |                |                  |                   |
            LEFT-WALL asdf[!ANY-WORD] qwerty[!ANY-WORD] fgh[!SIMPLE-STEM].= =jbbb[!SIMPLE-SUFF]

<h3>Linguistic Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
Link Grammar is a natural language parser, not a human-level artificial
general intelligence. This means that there are many sentences that it
cannot parse correctly, or at all.
There are entire classes of speech and writing that it cannot handle,
including twitter posts, IRC chat logs, Valley-girl basilect, Old and
Middle English, stock-market listings and raw HTML dumps.</p>

<p>Link Grammar works best with "newspaper English", as taught to and
written by those educated in American colleges: standard-sized sentences,
with proper grammar, proper punctuation, and correct capitalization.
Link Grammar has difficulties with the following types of textual
input:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Phrases (that are not a part of a complete sentence). There
    is some support for incomplete sentences with ellipsis. Many
    kinds of short phrases that can be interpreted as commands or
    instructions or exclamations are supported.
<li>Twitter posts. These tend to be sentence fragments, often
    lacking proper grammatical structure. You should strip off
    hash-tags before sending text into the parser.
<li>Any text containing a large number of spelling errors. The
    parser does have a built-in "spelling-guesser", which explores
    alternative spellings for words.
<li>"Registers", such as newspaper headlines, where determiners
    are omitted; for example, "Thieves rob bank." Note, however,
    a "dialect" support system is in development, which can be
    used to alter ranking favorability for different forms of
    expression within a single dictionary.
<li>Dialog, stage plays and movie scripts. Such dialog tends
    to consist of interleaved sentences. External software would
    be needed to disentangle distinct sentence streams.
<li>Speech-to-text output. Such systems generate large numbers of
    mis-heard words that, taken at face value cannot be a part
    of valid sentences. Even if such recognition was perfect,
    spoken English tends not to be as well-constructed or
    grammatical as written English.
<li>Support for British English and Commonwealth English is poor.
    This includes any English dialects spoken in India, Pakistan,
    Nigeria, Bangladesh, South Africa, as well as former American
    protectorates, such as the Philippines. British and regional
    spelling of words is missing from the dictionaries.
    The "dialect" support subsystem should be able to alleviate
    this, provided that the lexis is appropriately curated.
<li>Slang and various regional non-middle-class-American
    dialects. This includes most dialects spoken by anyone
    living in economically poor or under-educated geographical
    regions, whether in urban housing projects or the red-state
    small-town and rural poor.  Self-identifying subgroup dialects
    are also not handled, such as drug-culture, gang-culture and
    hacker-culture.
    The "dialect" support subsystem should be able to alleviate
    this, provided that the lexis is appropriately curated.
<li>Long run-on sentences. These can generate thousands of
    alternative parses in a combinatorial explosion.
</ul>
<p>
It is hoped that the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3372">unsupervised learning of
language</a> proposal will be of sufficient power and ability to handle
most of these exceptional cases. Work is currently ongoing.

    5.0.0 (April 2014).  This includes a copy of the
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/perstem">Persian stemming</a>
    engine, as significant morphology analysis needs to be performed
    to parse Persian.

<h3>Dead Projects</h3>
Here's a list of all of the
<a href="dead-project-archive.html">dead and obsolete projects</a>
that once used Link Grammar, but are no more. Some of these have been
merged into the mainline distro. The rest have been lost to the sands
of time, published on websites that no longer exist.

<p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>Version 5.12.1 (5 March 2023)</p>
<p>Improved AtomSpace behavior. In this version, MST parsing becomes
not just usable, but also fast.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Assorted enhancements and fixes for the AtomSpace dictionary. #1362
<li>Fix missing HAVE_THREADS_H, affects Apple Homebrew. #1363
<li>Fix regex thread-safety issue. #1370

<p>Version 5.12.0 (26 November 2022)</p>
<p>
This release contains an important bug-fix for a multi-threaded race
and crash in the regex code. This is quite rare: I was seeing a crash
after 24 hours when running 6 threads. If you're not running at that level,
chances are slim you'll see it. But still.
<p>
Also notable: this version can attach to a live dictionary running in
the AtomSpace. This offers some major improvements over the previous
version; a bit more is planned, as integration becomes tighter.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fix crash when using the Atomese dictionary backend.
<li>Fix generation tokenization bug when dict has no unknown word token.
<li>Major Atomese dictionary extensions, including generation support.
<li>Minor tweaks to `any` uniform random parse tree language.
<li>Include U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE as a space character.
<li>Fix the various regexes so that they're thread safe! #1354
<li>Maybe(?) fix FreeBSD missing <kbd>-lstdthreads</kbd> #1355
</ul>

<p>Version 5.11.0 (27 September 2022)</p>
<p>
Most notable in this release is a preliminary prototype interface to
the OpenCog AtomSpace. This allows working directly with language data
in the AtomSpace; avoiding the need to export the language model.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Prototype support for dictionary in the AtomSpace.
<li>English dict: assorted missing nouns, verbs. #1289
<li>Performance improvements. #1309
<li>Fix Windows build break in 5.10.4, 5.10.5 fixed in #1313
<li>Fix "amy" language #1312
